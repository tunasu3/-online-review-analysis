Retail Product Review Analysis

"Sentiment analysis and machine learning model for e-commerce product reviews."

Project Overview

I’ll be analyzing customer reviews from e-commerce platforms to uncover key insights about consumer sentiment and product quality. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), I aim to identify trends, extract sentiment, and even predict product ratings based on review text.

Using data scraping, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling, I will explore how customer feedback reflects real product performance and satisfaction. This project will help businesses and consumers make data-driven purchasing decisions while also enhancing my expertise in data science methodologies.

Objectives

1.	Understand Consumer Sentiment

-Analyze customer feedback to determine positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

-Identify frequent keywords in high- and low-rated reviews.

2.	Identify Key Factors Impacting Ratings

-Detect patterns in reviews of different product categories

-Explore how factors like review length, sentiment score, and word choice correlate with product ratings.

3.	Apply Data Science Skills

-Train a model to predict product ratings

-Improve my understanding of data visualization, sentiment analysis, and text mining.

Motivation

This project combines two key interests: data science and consumer behavior analysis. Here’s why this project is important:

•	Data-Driven Decision Making

 Instead of relying on intuition, this project provides quantitative insights into customer preferences.

•	Skill Development

 It’s an opportunity to apply machine learning, NLP, and web scraping techniques in a meaningful way.

•	Enhancing Shopping Quality Through Data-Driven Analysis of Product

The ultimate goal is to improve the shopping experience

Dataset

The dataset consists of product reviews from e-commerce platforms. The data will be enriched with additional information, such as product categories and metadata.

•	Data Sources

Primary Source: Publicly available reviews from Amazon

Enrichment Data: Additional product details like price, category, and brand

Technologies

Python	Data cleaning & statistical analysis

Pandas	Data manipulation & preprocessing

Scrapy 	Web scraping

Analysis Plan

•	Sentiment Score vs. Rating

Compare sentiment scores with user ratings (1-5 stars)

•	Word Cloud Analysis

Generate a word cloud for 5-star vs. 1-star reviews

•	Predicting Ratings Based on Review Text

Train an ML model to classify reviews into rating categories

Conclusion

By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

•	How do customer sentiments align with product ratings?

•	Can machine learning accurately predict product ratings based on review text?

•	What keywords are most commonly used in positive vs. negative reviews?

•	How can businesses leverage this analysis to improve products and marketing?
